How can I assist you today?"}, {"user": "what files do we have?", "assistant": "The relevant documents provided for this conversation are:\n1. \"The derivation of the Planck constant and the quantization of space v_2.pdf, Page 20\"\n   - This document discusses the rationalized metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second (rmks) or \u201cmetre\u2013kilogram\u2013second\u2013ampere\u201d equation system used to define SI units.\n   - It mentions that since the redefinition of SI units in 2019, the vacuum permeability \u03bc\u2080 is no longer a defined constant but needs to be determined experimentally. The document provides its value as approximately 1.25663706212 \u00d7 10^-6 H/m.\n   - Before this redefinition, \u03bc\u2080 had an exact defined value of 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m \u2248 1.2566370614 \u00d7 10^-6 N/A\u00b2. The difference between the two values appears at the 9th decimal place.\n   - It also discusses where the factor 4\u03c0 comes from, explaining that it balances out 1/4\u03c0 from the expression for \u03b5\u2080 to make 2.\n\nThe conversation history shows a greeting exchange with no previous questions related to the documents' content."}, {"user": "now what files do we have?", "assistant": "The relevant documents provided for this conversation are:\n\n1. **\"The Geometry of Particles and the Explanation of their Creation and Decay\"**\n   - **Authors:** Jeff Yee & Lori-Anne Gardi\n   - **Published in:** October 2019\n\n2. **\"The derivation of the Planck constant h and the quantization of space\"** (Two identical copies)\n   - **Author:** Oyvind Alv Liberg\n   - **Published in:** December 2022"}, {"user": "okay", "assistant": ""}]
