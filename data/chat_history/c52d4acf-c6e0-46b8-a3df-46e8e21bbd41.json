The first excerpt discusses the derivation of Planck's constant and quantization, while the second and third are essentially duplicates discussing changes to Coulomb's force law dimensions due to a redefinition of constants like C (Coulomb) and G (Gravitational)."}, {"user": "what files do we have, which we can work over?", "assistant": "Based on the provided context, we have three files that are essentially duplicates of each other. They all discuss the derivation of Planck's constant and quantization, as well as changes to Coulomb's force law dimensions due to a redefinition of constants like C (Coulomb) and G (Gravitational). Here is a summary of the relevant information from these documents:\n\n1. **Document 1:**\n   - Discusses that dependency has never been observed.\n   - Suggests building a new theory using the numerical value e spacek\uf072 = .\n   - Postulates that space\uf072 = 8.9875517873681764 \u00d7 10^9 kg/m\u00b3.\n\n2. **Documents 2 and 3:** (These are duplicates of Document 1)\n\nSince all three documents contain the same information, we can work over any one of them for our discussion or analysis purposes."}]
